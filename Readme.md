# ðŸ§  U-Net Based Self-Supervised MRI Denoising

This repository provides an implementation of a **self-supervised learning model for denoising MRI scans** using a tensorflow based U-Net backbone.
---

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **U-Net architecture** optimized for 2D/3D MRI scan denoising.
- **Self-supervised training** (no clean targets required).
- **Supports NIfTI (`.nii`) and DICOM data** loading.
- Evaluation metrics: PSNR, SSIM, MSE.
